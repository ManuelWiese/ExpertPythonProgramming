Chaper 2: Syntax Best Practices - below the Class Level

* Strings and Bytes
** In python2 str was represented by byte strings
** In python3 str is an immutable sequence that stores Unicode strings
** byte strings are now called bytes
*** bytes only allow integers >= 0 and <= 255 as sequence value(duh...)
** In python3 every unprefixed string literal is unicode(this i great!)
*** the u prefix is still allowed for backwards compatibility
